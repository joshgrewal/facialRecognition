# Facial recognition attendance system
## Instructions:

### First clone the repo in git bash using: 
```
git clone https://github.com/joshgrewal/facialRecognition.git
```
### Second we need to run the `requirements.txt` to install the dependencies using:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Then we must create the sql database. Do this by copying the commands in the `database.sql` file in a locally hosted instance. Once this is done you must edit your `gui_attendance.py` to accustom to your locally hosted instanceâ€™s host, user, and password.

### To run the code run: 
```
python gui_attendance.py  # Or run: python3 gui_attendance.py 
```
You must create a student first in order for the take attendance button to recognize you.
